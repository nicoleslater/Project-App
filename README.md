# Project-App
First Project Of Module 2 

I would like to create an application for children if they need to place an order for their parent its easy for them to use. I have installed the nanoid and chalk because I believe children are fascinateby bright colors. They also have the inclination to want to help mom or dad when it comes to a mobile device, laptop etc.
